 * 
 * 5. Add Two Numbers
 * 
 * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative 
 * integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes 
 * contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked 
 * list.
 * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the 
 * number 0 itself.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
 * Output: [7,0,8]
 * Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
 * Output: [0]
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
 * Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * -> The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
 * -> 0 <= Node.val <= 9
 * -> It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have 
 * leading zeros.

     * Approach 1: Elementary Math
     * 
     * Intuition
     * Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits 
     * sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant 
     * digit.
     * 
     * Algorithm
     * Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by 
     * summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of l1 and l2. 
     * Since each digit is in the range of 0â€¦9, summing two digits may 
     * "overflow". For example 5+7=12. In this case, we set the 
     * current digit to 2 and bring over the carry=1 to the next 
     * iteration. carry must be either 0 or 1 because the largest 
     * possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9+9+1=19.
     * The pseudocode is as following:
     * -> Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
     * -> Initialize carry to 0.
     * -> Initialize p and q to head of l1 and l2 respectively.
     * -> Loop through lists l1 and l2 until you reach both ends.
     *      -> Set x to node p's value. If p has reached the end of l1, set to 0.
     *      -> Set y to node q's value. If q has reached the end of l2, set to 0.
     *      -> Set sum=x+y+carry.
     *      -> Update carry=sum/10.
     *      -> Create a new node with the digit value of (sum mod 10) and set it 
     *      to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
     *      -> Advance both p and q.
     * -> Check if carry=1, if so append a new node with digit 1 to the 
     * returning list.
     * -> Return dummy head's next node.
     * Note that we use a dummy head to simplify the code. Without a dummy head, 
     * you would have to write extra conditional statements to initialize the 
     * head's value.
     * Take extra caution of the following cases:
     * ----------------------------------------
     * Test case        |       Explanation
     * ----------------------------------------
     * l1=[0,1]         |   When one list is longer than the other.
     * l2=[0,1,2]	|
     * ----------------------------------------
     * l1=[]            |   When one list is null, which means an empty list.
     * l2=[0,1]         |
     * -----------------------------------------
     * l1=[9,9]         |   The sum could have an extra carry of one at the end, 
     * l2=[1]           |   which is easy to forget.
     * -----------------------------------------
     * 
     * Complexity Analysis
     * -> Time complexity : O(max(m,n)). Assume that m and n represents the 
     * length of l1l1 and l2l2 respectively, the algorithm above iterates at 
     * most max(m,n) times.
     * -> Space complexity : O(max(m,n)). The length of the new list is at most 
     * max(m,n)+1.

            int sum = carry + x + y;

        }
        if (carry > 0) {
            curr.next = new ListNode(carry);

	4. [Prototype](./designpattern/04prototype.md)
    5. [Singleton](./designpattern/05singleton.md)
    6. [Abstract Factory](./designpattern/06abstractfactory.md)
    7. [Object Pool](./designpattern/07objectpool.md)

    5. [Facade](./designpattern/12facade.md)
    6. [Flyweight](./designpattern/13flyweight.md)
    7. [Proxy](./designpattern/14proxy.md)

# Composite
- We have a part-whole relationship or hierarchy of objects and we want to be able to treat all objects in this hierarchy uniformly.
- This is NOT a simple composition concept from object oriented programming but a further enhancement to that principal.
- Think of composite pattern when dealing with tree structure of objects.

## Implement
- We start by creating an abstract class/interface for Component
	- Component must declare all methods that are applicable to both leaf and composite.
	- We have to choose who defines the children management operations, component or composite.
	- Then we implement the composite. An operation invoked on composite is propagated to all its children
	- In leaf nodes we have to handle the non-applicable operations like add/remove a child if they are defined in component.
- In the end, a composite pattern implementation will allow you to write algorithms without worrying about whether node is leaf or composite.

**Implentation Considerations**
- You can provide a method to access parent of a node. This will simplify traversal of the entire tree.
- You can define the collection field to maintain children in base component instead of composite but again that field has no use in leaf class.
- If leaf objects can be repeated in the hierarchy then shared leaf nodes can be used to save memory and initialization costs. But again the number of nodes is major deciding factor as using a cache for small total number of nodes may cost more.

**Design Considerations**
- Decision needs to be made about where child management operations are defined. Defining them on component provides transparency but leaf nodes are forced to implement those methods. Defining them on composite is safer but client needs to be made aware of composite.
- Overall goal of design should be to make client code easier to implement when using composite. This is possible if client code can work with component interface only and doesn't need to worry about leaf-composite distinction.

### Example
- Composite is used in many UI frameworks, since it easily allows to represent a tree of UI controls.
